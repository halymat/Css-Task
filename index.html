        <h3>My Name is Sadiat Abu</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a little kid I have been fascinated with technology and the various ways it can impact our lives. Now, if you've ever wondered what it would be like to live in a time in which all of those things you now use without thinking didn't exist,
                you probably understand how important technology is for all of us living in today's society. There are some many reasons i love technology.
            </p>
            <h3>IT LETS YOU HAVE MORE FREE TIME</h3>
            <p>
                to put yourself in your grandma's or, even better, great-grandma's, shoes no dishwasher, no washer, no blender, mixer, Crockpot, microwave oven! I am tempted to add “no TV” as well but it makes no difference - a woman living without all of this modern
                tech couldn't care less about a TV, she didn't even have time to watch it! We will presume she did have running water and, in case of your great-great grandma, even that's a stretch! Horrible, isn't it? I can't even imagine what it would
                be like to do everything by hand and I am sure you can't either. We can just shrug it off with an “oh, well…different times” and continue to read our books, watch our TV shows, play with the children or paint our nails to the background
                music of our appliances doing their work.
            </p>
            <h3>IT MAKES YOU SMARTER</h3>
            <p>
                Books used to be a privilege of the rich but that all changed with the technical revolution and progressed even further in the years that followed. We not only have books and education our non-noble ancestors could only dream of, but means to seek and
                single out information in a heartbeat, which is something not even our parents could do as easily. Ebooks, audiobooks, Internet we have this huge poll of all kinds of knowledge! History, religion, art, languages, science, useful facts
                and things you may never get to use but want to know just for the fun of it all easily accessible and waiting for the eager and the willing!
            </p>
            <h3>IT HELPS YOU KEEP IN TOUCH</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine having to write a letter to your friend, wait like a month for it to arrive, then another month to get a reply! Ugh! Now imagine having to go through all that even if you don't enjoy reading or writing! And there you are wondering why to love
                technology! Enough said! Think about it the next time you grab your phone and take time to notice how much easier it is for us now to keep in touch with friends and family, even if they live on a different side of the globe.
            </p>
            <h3>IT's FUN</h3>
            <p>
                It's a very simple reason to love technology but it sure is an important one. We've got TV, music, news, gossips, games all in the palm of our hands! We can record our favorite TV shows, buy and rent movies and spend a fun evening at home, relaxing after
                a busy day at work. It does make us less outgoing and sociable than our grandparents, but also allows us to have a good time even when we're not in the mood for company and suits the needs of a modern human who works more and stresses
                more.
            </p>
            <h3>IT SAVES TIME AND MONEY</h3>
            <p>
                Technology helps you organize your life and work better, allows you to access information the moment you need it, helps you buy and sell stuff easier, enables you to find the best price for the items you need. Time is money, let's not forget that. But
                that's not where the story ends! Modern tools and techniques, quality control methods, mass production even in the field of technologically very advanced products all of those things are tied together and enable us to get a better product
                for the least amount of money!

            <h3>What I have learned sor far</h3>
            <p>
                First of all I will like to appreciate the wonderfull work of this platform,so far so good i have achieved so much in this platform. I have learnt how to use git and gitup,how to push to gitup repository, how to create new branch, how to collaborate with
                developers etc. I have also learlt html and its different tags and how to use them.
            </p>
            <h3>Important of CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets are an important way to control how your web pages look. CSS controls the fonts, text, colors, backgrounds, margins, and layout. CSS offers several significant advantages over alternative approaches to web design.
            </p>
            <h4>Modify Your Site Designs to Look How You Want Them to Look</h4>
            <p>
                It's easy to take a free Web template and build a website. But these templates rarely inspire by their elegance, so your website will look like every other site on the internet. By learning CSS you can modify these templates so that they display your
                colors and styles. Thus, you'll have a customized website without a lot of effort.
            </p>
            <h4>Build More Diverse Websites</h4>
            <p>
                CSS supports sites that look very different from page to page, without a lot of extensive coding. For example, many sites now perform slight color variations on the different sections of the site. Using page IDs, you can change the CSS for each section
                and use the same HTML structure for each section. The only thing that changes is the content and the CSS.
            </p>
            <h4>Redesign Your Site More Quickly</h4>
            <p>
                Many older websites that were built without CSS prove difficult to redesign. But once a site is built with CSS hooks, it can be redesigned very quickly. Changing things like the colors and backgrounds refresh how a site looks with very little effort.
                In fact, many sites now put up special versions of their sites for special occasions and they can do this because it only takes a few hours to create an alternate stylesheet for the occasion.

            <h3>The difference between Margin, Padding and Border</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Padding </span> - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Margin</span> - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Border</span> - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main difference between padding and margin is that padding controls how much breathing room exists within a box, while margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box. Margins, on the other hand, are essentially invisible
                barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen. Margins can be set to zero and above like padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative
                values.
